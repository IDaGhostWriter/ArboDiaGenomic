## Sylvatic DENV Reemergence: A Duality between Senegal (West Africa) and Malaysia (Southeast Asia)

Figure 1: Dual Sylvatic Dengue virus 2 Re-emergence throught gene target failure

**1. Our Previous Work (Senegal Context) (Dieng et al., 2022 / Dieng et al., 2024)**

- We demonstrated that three commonly used molecular serotyping assays failed to assign sylvatic **DENV-2** to any serotype.  
- This was not a laboratory artifact but a diagnostic blind spot: primers and probes optimized for urban dengue lineages poorly match divergent sylvatic genomes.  
- Cases in Senegal (Kolda, 2021; Kédougou, 2020) show that sylvatic dengue continues to spill over into humans. Yet, current surveillance underestimates its presence, as “undetermined serotype” results are often dismissed rather than investigated.  
- To address this, we developed and optimized oligo sets tailored for sylvatic diversity, highlighting the need to either rethink serotyping tools or systematically leverage assay failures alongside complementary molecular methods.

**2. The Malaysian Study (Suppiah et al.,2025)**

- Researchers in Malaysia reported human cases labelled as “undetermined serotype.”  
- Sequencing confirmed these were sylvatic **DENV-2** (and a divergent **DENV-3**), revealing the same diagnostic blind spot we observed in Senegal.  
- The failures stemmed from primer–probe mismatches due to genetic divergence, not absence of the virus.  
- Their analysis also highlighted amino-acid signatures in sylvatic **DENV-2** that explain diagnostic mismatches, mirroring our findings in West Africa.

**3. The Duality**

These complementary observations reveal a clear mirror between two geographically distant regions:

| West Africa (Senegal) | Southeast Asia (Malaysia) |
|---|---|
| 2020–2021 human infections labelled “unassigned serotype” → actually sylvatic **DENV-2**  |  2024–2025 cases labelled “undetermined serotype” → mostly sylvatic **DENV-2**  |
| Failure of three serotyping assays (our work)  | Failure of commercial diagnostic kits (Suppiah et al., 2025) |
| Developed oligo strategies (singleplex & multiplex with urban genotypes) to bridge the gap | Identified genomic/AA signatures explaining diagnostic failure |

**Key Messages**

- Two distant regions (Africa ↔ Asia) report the same phenomenon: assay failures masking sylvatic dengue.  
- The hidden culprit is convergent: sylvatic dengue lineages diverging from urban genotypes.  
- The shared risk is a surveillance blind spot, leading to an underestimated sylvatic disease burden.

**4. Framing the Implications**

- **Continuity:** Our Senegal research anticipated and addressed this diagnostic gap; Malaysian findings independently validate the phenomenon.  
- **Global Duality:** Sylvatic dengue emergence is not a local anomaly — it exposes a convergent surveillance weakness across continents.  
- **Call to Action:** These observations collectively argue for a paradigm shift in diagnostics: routine assays must evolve beyond urban serotypes and systematically integrate sylvatic diversity. This is precisely the direction pursued by our oligo strategies.
