    "text": "Idrissa Dieng is spearheading research into viruses, with a primary focus on arboviruses, particularly delving into molecular evolution and the advancement of diagnostic tools. Since its initial detection in Senegal in 1979, Dengue virus has been a prominent concern. The viral landscape, until 2009, was primarily characterized by the presence of sylvatic DENV-2 strains. However, a significant transition occurred with the onset of the first urban epidemic. Subsequently, annual epidemics have been documented since 2017. Despite this persistent circulation, there has been limited understanding of the genetic diversity of the virus.\nTo bridge this knowledge gap, we have utilized Next Generation Sequencing technologies, including Illumina and Nanopore, to conduct genomic surveillance of circulating viral strains in Senegal. This initiative is integrated into the Senegalese Syndromic Sentinel Surveillance program (4S Network). By doing so, we can effectively monitor the genetic composition of the virus and evaluate its implications for preventive, therapeutic, and diagnostic interventions.\nFurthermore, the insights gained and the advancements made in dengue diagnostics and genomic surveillance have been extended to other West African countries where dengue surveillance programs are deficient, such as Cabo Verde.

OMiCount is designed to improve laboratory work, maximize precision and save time. To strengthen its wide use, In collaboration with Mamadou Cisse of the Digitalization and Information System Department (DDSI), the tool will soon be available to the general public via a web portal. The Oligonucleotides Mismatches Counter (OMiCount) is a transformative bioinformatics tool that evaluates the performance of primer sets against a diverse array of virus variants. This innovation significantly enhances molecular diagnostics and genomic characterization, making substantial contributions to virology, public health, and genomic surveillance. OMiCount has also contributed to the discovery of a key element in the diagnosis of the chikungunya virus. The discovery was published online last week CDC Trioplex diagnostic assay underperforms in detection of circulating Chikungunya West African genotype\nKey Impacts of OMiCount:\n\nImproved Molecular Diagnostics: Primer Validation, Rapid Adaptation, Efficiency and Degenerate Primer Design.  \nEnhanced Genomic Characterization: Comprehensive Analysis, Visual Representation and Optimized Primers \nSupporting Genomic Surveillance: Real-Time Monitoring, Accurate Detection and Adaptability.  \nFacilitating Public Health Responses: Timely Identification, Resource Optimization and Enhanced Testing Capabilities. \nGlobal Health Impact: Preparedness and Response, Collaborative Efforts and Innovation in Diagnostics. \n\nIn summary, OMiCount significantly enhances molecular diagnostics and genomic characterization by providing a simple, reliable, efficient, and comprehensive method for oligonucleotide performance evaluation. Its ability to adapt to viral evolution, generate degenerate primers, and offer clear visualizations of primer performance makes it an indispensable tool in the ongoing efforts to combat viral diseases and the mitigation of their impact in public health.\nCheck out my researchgate web page to learn more about my scientifique publications for more info on how to get the most out of my work.

    "section": "",
    "text": ". .\nAbstract:\nZika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne virus of concern for public health, but very little is known about its transmission patterns and ecology, especially in African countries. Here, we expanded the genomic information by sequencing Zika viruses isolated from mosquitoes collected in Kedougou, Senegal, located in Western Africa. All new genomes are part of the African genotype, within the virus lineage previously characterized as the Western Lineage. Sequences were strongly clustered by sampling location and date of the collection respectively, suggesting a highly focal geographical and temporal distribution. Our phylogeographic reconstructions indicated that the African genotype of the Zika virus Western Lineage emerged in the Western part of Africa mostly following an East-to-West migration pattern. The analyses further revealed that the African genotype of the Zika virus was likely introduced in Western Africa between 1957 and 1974. Since the emergence of the Zika virus in Western Africa, we found a decrease in the effective population size of the Zika virus Western Lineage, but stagnating in recent years in the Kedougou region. Over time, no significant increase was recorded in the CAI values for A. aegypti and H. sapiens. In summary, the integrated results indicate that the African genotype ZIKV continues to circulate in forest areas, using sylvatic mosquitoes as vectors in Western Africa, with a long period of persistence at a local scale, with an accumulation of diversity over time, and without any evidence of adaptation based in CAI values to the urban environment.\nKeywords : Zika virus; African genotype; Senegal; Western Lineage; Western Africa"
