    "text": "Idrissa Dieng is spearheading research into viruses, with a primary focus on arboviruses, particularly delving into molecular evolution and the advancement of diagnostic tools. Since its initial detection in Senegal in 1979, Dengue virus has been a prominent concern. The viral landscape, until 2009, was primarily characterized by the presence of sylvatic DENV-2 strains. However, a significant transition occurred with the onset of the first urban epidemic. Subsequently, annual epidemics have been documented since 2017. Despite this persistent circulation, there has been limited understanding of the genetic diversity of the virus.\nTo bridge this knowledge gap, we have utilized Next Generation Sequencing technologies, including Illumina and Nanopore, to conduct genomic surveillance of circulating viral strains in Senegal. This initiative is integrated into the Senegalese Syndromic Sentinel Surveillance program (4S Network). By doing so, we can effectively monitor the genetic composition of the virus and evaluate its implications for preventive, therapeutic, and diagnostic interventions.\nFurthermore, the insights gained and the advancements made in dengue diagnostics and genomic surveillance have been extended to other West African countries where dengue surveillance programs are deficient, such as Cabo Verde.
