    "text": "Abstract: Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most prevalent arboviral threats worldwide. The virus is associated with a high health and economic burden mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Available molecular tools however fail to correctly serotype and sequence sylvatic DENV-2 (DENV-2/GVI) which in known to circulate in forests in West Africa and Malaysia. The recent emergence of human case linked to this virus variant in Southern Senegal raises concerns about the correct detection and characterization of the virus for public health purposes. Here we develop and validate new sets of oligonucleotides to detect, discriminate and sequence DENV-2/GVI. Validations were carried out using epidemic DENV and sylvatic DENV-2 strains from the biobank of the WHO collaborating Center for Arboviruses and Haemorrhagic fevers. The presented approaches showed good performance to specifically detect sylvatic DENV-2 in both singleplex and multiplex PCR with other DENV serotypes respectively with a limit of detection of 68.85 and 133.21 RNA copies/reaction at 0.95 probability in a probit analysis. Additionally, developed tilling PCR primers yield a better genome coverage ranging from 93.9 to 95.1 % for all processed DENV-2/GVI strains both on Illumina and Nanopore platforms and outperform previous schemes to efficiently amplified DENV-2/GVI strains. In summary the developed oligonucleotides will contribute to improving DENV surveillance and genomic epidemiology in endemic areas.\nClick to here to read the full article: Detection, Differentiation and Sequencing DENV-2/GVI"

This document shows an analysis of the molecular detection and Senegalese treatment of dengue virus strains, focusing on the failure to detect sylvatic strains of the virus. So-called in silico analyses detected high-significance mutations at the primer binding sites of pseudo-aggregate kits, which is harmful. These obstructions were circumvented by a simple diagnostic algorithm developed to overcome these limitations. The results illustrate the importance of integrating local genomic data to improve epidemiological surveillance tools and enable early detection of emerging variants. This study highlights the need for perfect interweaving of epidemic management diagnostic strategies and virus outbreaks.primers of pseudo-aggressive kits, which is harmful.

    "text": "Idrissa Dieng is spearheading research into viruses, with a primary focus on arboviruses, particularly delving into molecular evolution and the advancement of diagnostic tools. Since its initial detection in Senegal in 1979, Dengue virus has been a prominent concern. The viral landscape, until 2009, was primarily characterized by the presence of sylvatic DENV-2 strains. However, a significant transition occurred with the onset of the first urban epidemic. Subsequently, annual epidemics have been documented since 2017. Despite this persistent circulation, there has been limited understanding of the genetic diversity of the virus.\nTo bridge this knowledge gap, we have utilized Next Generation Sequencing technologies, including Illumina and Nanopore, to conduct genomic surveillance of circulating viral strains in Senegal. This initiative is integrated into the Senegalese Syndromic Sentinel Surveillance program (4S Network). By doing so, we can effectively monitor the genetic composition of the virus and evaluate its implications for preventive, therapeutic, and diagnostic interventions.\nFurthermore, the insights gained and the advancements made in dengue diagnostics and genomic surveillance have been extended to other West African countries where dengue surveillance programs are deficient, such as Cabo Verde.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nZika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne virus of concern for public health, but very little is known about its transmission patterns and ecology, especially in African countries. Here, we expanded the genomic information by sequencing Zika viruses isolated from mosquitoes collected in Kedougou, Senegal, located in Western Africa. All new genomes are part of the African genotype, within the virus lineage previously characterized as the Western Lineage. Sequences were strongly clustered by sampling location and date of the collection respectively, suggesting a highly focal geographical and temporal distribution. Our phylogeographic reconstructions indicated that the African genotype of the Zika virus Western Lineage emerged in the Western part of Africa mostly following an East-to-West migration pattern. The analyses further revealed that the African genotype of the Zika virus was likely introduced in Western Africa between 1957 and 1974. Since the emergence of the Zika virus in Western Africa, we found a decrease in the effective population size of the Zika virus Western Lineage, but stagnating in recent years in the Kedougou region. Over time, no significant increase was recorded in the CAI values for A. aegypti and H. sapiens. In summary, the integrated results indicate that the African genotype ZIKV continues to circulate in forest areas, using sylvatic mosquitoes as vectors in Western Africa, with a long period of persistence at a local scale, with an accumulation of diversity over time, and without any evidence of adaptation based in CAI values to the urban environment.\nKeywords : Zika virus; African genotype; Senegal; Western Lineage; Western Africa"

The aim of this project is to develop a multiplex RT-qPCR system to detect and differentiate the three main genotypes of Chikungunya virus (Africa, ECSA, Asia). Specific primers and probes were designed on the basis of E1 gene sequence analysis, with validation to avoid cross-reactivity with other alphaviruses. The study used viral RNA samples extracted from different strains to assess the specificity and sensitivity of the system. The results demonstrated reliable detection and differentiation of genotypes. This system is a valuable tool for molecular surveillance and epidemic control in high-risk areas."

    "text": "Abstract: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread arthropod-borne virus, with the number and severity of outbreaks increasing worldwide in recent decades. Dengue is caused by genetically distinct serotypes, DENV-1–4. Here, we present data on DENV-1, isolated from patients with dengue fever during an outbreak in Senegal and Mali (Western Africa) in 2015–2019, that were analyzed by sequencing the envelope (E) gene. The emergence and the dynamics of DENV-1 in Western Africa were inferred by using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The DENV-1 grouped into a monophyletic cluster that was closely related to those from Southeast Asia. The virus appears to have been introduced directly into Medina Gounass (Suburb of Dakar), Senegal (location probability = 0.301, posterior = 0.76). The introduction of the virus in Senegal occurred around 2014 (95% HPD = 2012.88–2014.84), and subsequently, the virus moved to regions within Senegal (e.g., Louga and Fatick), causing intense outbreaks in the subsequent years. The virus appears to have been introduced in Mali (a neighboring country) after its introduction in Senegal. In conclusion, we present evidence that the outbreak caused by DENV-1 in urban environments in Senegal and Mali after 2015 was caused by a single viral introduction from Asia\nClick to here to read the full article: Phylodynamic DENV-1 Senegal"

    "text": "Abstract:\nDengue virus (DENV) is one of the most prevalent arboviral threats worldwide. The virus is associated with a high health and economic burden mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Available molecular tools however fail to correctly serotype and sequence sylvatic DENV-2 (DENV-2/GVI) which in known to circulate in forests in West Africa and Malaysia. The recent emergence of human case linked to this virus variant in Southern Senegal raises concerns about the correct detection and characterization of the virus for public health purposes. Here we develop and validate new sets of oligonucleotides to detect, discriminate and sequence DENV-2/GVI. Validations were carried out using epidemic DENV and sylvatic DENV-2 strains from the biobank of the WHO collaborating Center for Arboviruses and Haemorrhagic fevers. The presented approaches showed good performance to specifically detect sylvatic DENV-2 in both singleplex and multiplex PCR with other DENV serotypes respectively with a limit of detection of 68.85 and 133.21 RNA copies/reaction at 0.95 probability in a probit analysis. Additionally, developed tilling PCR primers yield a better genome coverage ranging from 93.9 to 95.1 % for all processed DENV-2/GVI strains both on Illumina and Nanopore platforms and outperform previous schemes to efficiently amplified DENV-2/GVI strains. In summary the developed oligonucleotides will contribute to improving DENV surveillance and genomic epidemiology in endemic areas.\nKeywords : Dengue virus; Sylvatic DENV-2 ; Senegal;Reemergence ; Detection ; Differentiation ; Ampliseq Sequencing"
