Omar aka *Pau Cubarsi* is a BsC student working on a project related to CHIKV diagnostic. The aim of this project is to develop a multiplex RT-qPCR system to detect and differentiate the three main genotypes of Chikungunya virus (Africa, ECSA, Asia).
Specific primers and probes were designed on the basis of E1 gene sequence analysis, with validation to avoid cross-reactivity with other alphaviruses.
The study used viral RNA samples extracted from different strains to assess the specificity and sensitivity of the system.
The results demonstrated reliable detection and differentiation of genotypes.
This system is a valuable tool for molecular surveillance and epidemic control in high-risk areas.
