Leon aka *Bernal* is a BsC student working on a project related to DENV diagnostic. The project presents an analysis of molecular detection 
and Senegalese treatment of dengue virus strains, focusing on the failure to detect sylvatic strains of the virus. In silico analyses detected 
high-significance mutations at the dengue virus binding sites. This document shows an analysis of the molecular detection and Senegalese treatment 
of dengue virus strains, focusing on the failure to detect sylvatic strains of the virus. So-called in silico analyses detected high-significance 
mutations at the primer binding sites of pseudo-aggregate kits, which is harmful. These obstructions were circumvented by a simple diagnostic algorithm
developed to overcome these limitations. The results illustrate the importance of integrating local genomic data to improve epidemiological
surveillance tools and enable early detection of emerging variants. This study highlights the need for perfect interweaving of epidemic management 
diagnostic strategies and virus outbreaks.primers of pseudo-aggressive kits, which is harmful. These obstructions were bypassed by a simple diagnostic
algorithm developed to circumvent these limitations.
